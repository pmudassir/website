            <h3>Mumbai</h3>
            <p>
                Mumbai, the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra, is a spectacular paradox of chaos and hope, glamour and squalor, modernity and tradition. Famously known as the City of Dreams, Mumbai – formerly known as Bombay - Mumbai is a beautifully blended melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The city soaks in everything into its fabric, making it it's very own. From upcoming actors struggling to make it big on the silver screen; from Bolly superstars to big industrialists to tribes of fishermen and slum dwellers, Mumbai is a city that proudly boasts of stories from different walks of human survival.
                One of the main centers in the country of art, culture, music, dance, and theatre, Mumbai is a dynamic, cosmopolitan city that has been running for years solely on the indomitable spirit of the Mumbaikars. Housing is largely privately owned, though there is some public housing built by the government through publicly funded corporations or by private cooperatives with public funds. Mumbai is extremely crowded, and housing is scarce for anyone who is not wealthy. (For that reason, commercial and industrial enterprises have found it increasingly difficult to attract mid-level professional, technical, or managerial staff.) In an attempt to stem the ongoing immigration of unskilled labor that has increased the city’s indigent and homeless population, city planners have encouraged enterprises to locate across Mumbai Harbournotably in Navi mumbai and have banned the development and expansion of industrial units inside the city; their efforts, however, have been largely unsuccessful.
