                Ooty is one of the best hill stations in our country.  We have been planning to go to the best place during our summer vacation. Many people suggested us to go to Ooty for its cold weather and awesome spots.
                We planned a 3 day trip to Ooty and booked a resort before a week. We packed our luggage and boarded the bus to Ooty. In contrast to the Summer heat in our city, our trip to Ooty gave us a pleasant feeling. This cold temperature and wonderful natural sceneries are the centers of attraction.2
                The whole environment of Ooty â€“ Dodabetta Peak, Sims Park, Pykara Lake, Tea Garden, and many more drew us into happiness straight away. Boating in the lake would be fun-filled if you are going with a bunch of people. We took many photos in the most amazing scenic spots and those are memorable till now. The most awesome part of Ooty is the Botanical Garden. Thousands of flowers arranged in a mind-blowing manner are the main reason so many tourists to the Botanical garden. The best thing about Ooty is that we will happy in the company of nature. Not only nature, but we can also ride horses in Ooty. There are people in Ooty who lend horses for riding; you can enjoy riding if you love to do so. Many of my friends and I tried it out and enjoyed it very well. We thoroughly enjoyed each place in Ooty and felt comfortable with the food and accommodation. If you want to enjoy your summer vacation, Ooty is one good choice to go with your family and friends.
